# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the project

This Analysis is based on Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, which is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. We are tasked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data Martha will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, she has decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, Martha decided on a clustering algorithm. Sheâ€™ll use data visualizations to share her findings with the board.

### Steps followed for the analysis:
- Part 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Part 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Part 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Part 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Results

- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Outcome
Two type of scatter plot were used for visualizarion:
  - 3D-Scatter
